The **'_Skill_Detail'** page provides a focused view of a single skill selected from the main dashboard. It breaks down how often that skill appears in job postings, which industries are hiring for it, and what kinds of job titles and salary ranges are associated with it. The page also shows how demand for the skill changes over time. Overall, it gives a clear picture of the skill’s importance in the market and helps users understand where and how it is being used across different roles and industries.

**Drill-through from the Top Skills Bar Chart:**

It displays all relevant information—such as job titles, companies, required skills, workplace types, and posting dates—in a clean, searchable table. This page allows users to explore the underlying data behind the visuals and see exactly what kinds of roles are available in a specific country, giving deeper context to the trends shown on the main dashboard.
